639,PM2.5-Attributable Deaths ,Rate - Adults 30 Yrs and Older,"Estimated number of all-cause deaths associated with the difference in air quality for indicator years relative to modeled natural background. Estimate is calculated using the chronic all-cause mortality risk estimate from a comprehensive study by Krewski et al 2009.  The rate is the number of deaths attributable to PM2.5 among residents (30 years and older), divided by the population of residents (30 years and older) expressed as cases per 100,000 residents.","NYC BVS,US Census",New York City Bureau of Vital Statistics; United States Census
